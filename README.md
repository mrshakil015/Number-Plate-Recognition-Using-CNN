  <code>pyresparser</code> is a simple resume parser used for extracting information from resumes. pyresparser work with <code>spacy</code>. But now it don't work properly in <code>spacy latest version.</code> It's work better in <code>spacy==2.3.8</code> When we run pyresparser in <code>spacy</code>latest version show <code>config.cfg</code> problem. To solve this problem <code>create virtual environment.</code>

  ## Define Input Shape & Batch Size: </br>
```python
input_shape = (224, 224, 3)
batch_size = 32
```
### Code Explanatation: </br>
 - <strong>input_shape: </strong> This is a tuple that specifies the dimensions of the input images.In this case, the input images will have a width and height of 224 pixels and three color channels (red, green, and blue).
 -  <strong>batch_size: </strong> It is specifies the number of samples that will be fed into the model at once during training. In this case, the model will process 32 images at a time. 


  ## Define Base Model: </br>
```python
base_model = VGG16(input_shape=input_shape, include_top=False, weights='imagenet')
```
### Code Explanatation: </br>
This line of code creates a VGG16 model instance called base_model.
 - <strong> input_shape=input_shape: </strong> This parameter specifies the shape of the input data to the model.
 - <strong> weights='imagenet: </strong> TThis parameter specifies the pre-trained weights to use for the model.

  ## Custom Layer to the Pre-trained Model: </br>
```python
x = base_model.output
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(4, activation='linear')(x)
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=x)
```
### Code Explanatation: </br>
This code adds custom layers to the pre-trained model.
 - <strong> x = base_model.output: </strong> This line sets x to the output of the pre-trained VGG16 model, which is the last layer before the fully connected layers.
 - <strong> x = Flatten()(x): </strong> This line adds a Flatten layer to the model.
 - <strong> x = Dense(4, activation='linear')(x): </strong> This line adds a Dense layer to the model with 4 units and a linear activation function.
 - <strong> model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=x): </strong> This line creates a new model. This creates a new model that combines the pre-trained VGG16 model with our custom fully connected layers to perform object detection.
 


  ## Training configuration for the model: </br>
```python
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])
```
### Code Explanatation: </br>
This code sets up the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric for the model, preparing it for training.
 - <strong> optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0001): </strong> This line creates an instance of the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. The optimizer is used during training to adjust the weights of the model in order to minimize the loss function.
 - <strong> model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy']): </strong> This line <code>loss='mse'</code> specifies that we will use mean squared error as the loss function during training, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the true output. <code>optimizer=optimizer</code> specifies that we will use the Adam optimizer instance created in the previous line. <code>metrics=['accuracy']</code> specifies that we will track the accuracy metric during training.
 


## Save the best model: </br>
```python
save_vgg16_model = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    "/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Number-Plate-Recognition-Model/vgg16model.h5", 
    monitor='accuracy', 
    save_best_only=True, 
    verbose=1
)
```
### Code Explanatation: </br>
This code snippet creates a callback function using the tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint class that saves the best-performing model during the training process.

 - <code>"/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Number-Plate-Recognition-Model/vgg16model.h5":</code> This parameter specifies the path where the model weights will be saved.
 - <strong> monitor='accuracy: </strong> This tells the function to monitor the model's accuracy during training.
 - <strong> save_best_only=True: </strong> This parameter ensures that only the best model (based on the monitored metric) will be saved. If set to False, the function will save the model after every epoch.
 - <strong> verbose=1: </strong> This parameter sets the verbosity level of the output messages during training. A value of 1 means that progress updates will be printed to the console.

## Directory Path: </br>
```python
training_directory = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Number-Palte-Dataset/train'
validation_directory = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Number-Palte-Dataset/valid'
```
### Code Explanatation: </br>
These are the directory paths for the training and validation datasets used in this project.
